            <strong>sport </strong>includes all forms of competitive physical activity or games which,<br>
            [1] through casual or organised participation, aim to use,<br>
            maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants,<br>
            and in some cases, entertainment for spectators.[2] Hundreds of sports exist,<br>
            from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants<br>
            either in teams or competing as individuals
